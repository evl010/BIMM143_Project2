# BIMM143_Project2
I uploaded my first draft of Project 2 as a Jupyter notebook as well as an html.
I also uploaded the FASTA files (.fna) that were necessary for running the code within the notebook.
My scientific question is: Is keratin structurally the same in humans and house mice?
My scientific hypothesis is: If keratin is structurally the same in both humans and house mice then performing a comparison between the sequences of the KRT1 gene and models of the keratin protein from both species should result in many similarities.
